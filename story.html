          <h2>GTA 1 (1997)</h2>
          <p>
            Released by DMA Design (now Rockstar North), GTA 1 introduced a
            top-down perspective. Players could explore a large open-world and
            complete missions, which allowed them to steal cars and engage in
            criminal activities across three cities: Liberty City, San Andreas,
            and Vice City.

          <p>
            GTA: London 1969 and 1961 were expansion packs set in a 1960s
            British environment. These games retained the top-down view but
            introduced a unique setting compared to modern American cities.

            A sequel that expanded the open world, GTA 2 added new features like
            gang affiliations, which affected how NPCs reacted to the player. It
            also introduced a futuristic setting, making it distinct from the
            modern-day locations of other entries.

            A game-changer, GTA III moved the series to 3D, offering a
            third-person perspective with an open-world in Liberty City. It
            introduced a fully realized storyline, voice-acted characters, and
            unprecedented freedom for players, making it one of the most
            influential games in history.

            Set in a 1980s-inspired Vice City (based on Miami), Vice City built
            on GTA III’s success with improved visuals, a vibrant story, and
            memorable characters like Tommy Vercetti. The game had a unique '80s
            aesthetic with an iconic soundtrack.

            Taking place in the early 1990s in the fictional state of San
            Andreas (inspired by California and Nevada), San Andreas introduced
            RPG elements like character customization, fitness, and territory
            control. It offered three distinct cities: Los Santos, San Fierro,
            and Las Venturas.

            With the power of the RAGE engine, GTA IV brought Liberty City into
            high definition, offering a darker, more realistic tone. Protagonist
            Niko Bellic, an immigrant seeking the "American Dream," became a
            fan-favorite, and the game’s narrative depth was praised.
